# Week-1

I learnt about the Python libraries like Numpy, Scipy and Pandas. I wrote some small codes to understand the various methods. Since the libraries are very vast with a large number of methods available, so it is not possible to remember all of them. So I keep revising time to time and consult the resources in case of any doubt. I have also done the week-1 assignment.
# Week-2

I learnt about the concept of linear regression in machine learning and how to obtain a solution using gradient descent. I also solved the week-2 assignment and got clarity about the concept.

# Week-3
I learnt about the K-means algorithm and how to implement it. I also understood its drawbacks and that it may not provide the required grouping of data always but it is useful in many cases to group the data into clusters.

# Week-1 ()
The assignment file contains some questions regarding application of python libraries like numpy and pandas.

The solution file contains the solutions to the problems which we obtained.

# Week-2 ()
The assignnment file contains a problem where linear regression is to be used to come up with a model which can predict
