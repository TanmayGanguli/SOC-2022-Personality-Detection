# SOC-2022-Personality-Detection
#Week-1
I learnt about the Python libraries like Numpy, Scipy and Pandas. I wrote some small codes to understand the various methods. Since the libraries are very vast with a large number of methods available, so it is not possible to remember all of them. So I keep revising time to time and consult the resources in case of any doubt. I have also done the week-1 assignment.
#Week-2
I learnt about the concept of linear regression in machine learning and how to obtain a solution using gradient descent. I also solved the week-2 assignment and got clarity about the concept.
